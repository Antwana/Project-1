For this project I used HTML, CSS and Javascript

The first thing I did after completing the HTML and CSS was to try and get the radio and submit buttons to work. I tried using an array to minimize repetition but ended up doing what worked.

I will definitely have to work more on this project mainly the javascript and css portions. I would like for the trivia questions to fade in and out adn also for the page to be set up a little differently
